# Automatic-Ball-Launcher

This project uses a VL53L0X LIDAR sensor to detect proximity and control two motors and a servo for a ball-triggering system. The motors run at randomized speeds when an object is detected within range, and the servo releases the ball.

## Features
    •	LIDAR Detection: Uses the VL53L0X sensor to detect objects within 50mm range.
    •	Motor Control: Operates two motors with adjustable speed using PWM signals.
    •	Servo Actuation: Releases a ball via a servo mechanism triggered by object detection.
    •	Randomized Motor Speed: Adds variability for more dynamic motor operation.
